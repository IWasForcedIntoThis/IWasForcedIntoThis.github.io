                        Inspired by my military service I wanted to create a drone that —instead of causing death—
                        would instead prevent it. It would do so by assisting in the identification and removal
                        of Unexploded-Ordinance (UXOs) in civilian population centers and areas where they may contact

                        Initial plans used ground penetrating radar (GPR), but it was too expensive for me.
                        I instead focused on sensitive magnetometers, IR and visual imaging, and flagging.
                        By giving demining teams access to this type of equipment would facilitate safer and more
                        reliable UXO detection and elimination.

                    <h1>High Power Rocketry</h1>
                    <p>
                        My clubs in college have gotten me into High Power Rocketry as a hobby.
                        I love the challenges that come with it and my current challenge, in part as
                        my L1 certification for High Power Rocketry, is designing a rapidly repairable,
                        modular, simple assembly high power rocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also been central to the creation of various systems to assist in
                        launching and testing of rocketry systems. To include a launch pad which
                        was one of my first real technical drawing efforts before I started
                        working with Dr. Menoni.

                        My main role within this project was simulations and planning. As such I coded
                        a large MATLAB program to facilitate testing via Monte-Carlo simulations. This gave us
                        the ability to make long term projections of the rocket and base any alterations to design or
                        launch profile on the simulations. Whilst they still needed real-world verification before we
                        truly trusted them it allowed quality changes to be made. After it predicted the flight path of
                        one of our prototype rockets within three meters of its
                        actual landing we were confident in using it to plan and assess projects.

                        Taking inspiration from the Soviet <i>Energia-Buran</i> spaceplane and the NASA
                        <i>Space Shuttle</i> program we began divising ways to create a rocket, not just a booster,
                        that is able to glide back to its point of liftoff without significant human imput.
                        This has proven to be incredibly difficult in part due to scale and stability.
                        Generally you want a rocket to have a stability (Referred to as a Caliber of Stability)
                        around one. Higher and you lose maneuverability, but lower and you lose stable flight.

                        The current design as of 01 December 2025 focuses on turning traditional 3 tail fin rocket
                        design into one that implements wings in place of two of the fins and a vertical
                        stabalizer in place of the third and final fin. This is intended to be coupled with the
                        presence of 4 canards that are treated as expendable for the purposes of recovery.

                        During my time in the Army I worked with a lot of different automated
                        and semi-automated systems. The ones that intrigued me then though were
                        the UAVs. In particular I was fond of the Switchblade-600 Suicide Drones.
                        However, not in the way you may imagine.

                        I was fascinated by the way it detected and found its targets, but also being
                        aware of the life lost to these kinds of things I decided to do the opposite.
                        How can I use that technology to save lives? As such was born ARGUS.
