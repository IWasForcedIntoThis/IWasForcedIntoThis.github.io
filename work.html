            <p class="overview text">
                Despite being fairly young I have had a lot of experience in
                the working world. From the new of engineering research, design and execution
                all the way to my days performing music and writting essays. This breadth of knowledge,
                experience, understanding, and methedology has made me an excellent person to have
                for any project or company.
            </p>
            <p class="overview text">
                Beyond my technical expertise and hard skills I also have learned much from my life
                in the soft skills and those hard to teach life lessons. From the military I learned the
                necessity of acceptance of responsibility and the importance of diverse peoples and thoughts.
                From being a musician I learned the importance of hard work, dilligence to your craft,
                the drive to improve, and —much to my frustration— that <i>nothing</i> will ever be perfect.
                I don't know who first said it, but I've taken to the belief that perfect is the enemy of good.
                I have had to learn this in reasearch and in design where I always strove to do the perfect job
                and to make the perfect part. However, after months of failure and reflecting on it I had to remember
                the lessons the violin taught me. This has given me that unique ability in engineering to look for the
                simple. The simple solution, the simple cause, the simple fix, the simple design.
                Then when paired together the mass of the simple things becomes the better of a whole
                and creates a thing of estatic beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the most important lesson of all came from jouranlism. Can you guess it?
                You'll only notice the typo after you submit it.

                        Transitioned to legal NCO due to an injury. During this time I became heavily involved
                        in drone operation and training, foreign area advising, foreign language training,
                        and acted as advisor and trainer for new Stryker crewmembers.

                        Recived promotion to Sergeant due in part to the quality of my work and work ethic.
                        Finished my active duty service acting as a trainer for new soldiers and advisor to my
                        command team.

                        Recieved my first Army Commendation Medal towards the end of my active duty career for
                        creating a sytem of training and maintaining that gave my unit a renewed generation of
                        successful crewmembers and reinvigorated our culture and heritage of Stryker operations.

                        Began as a joint-venture with a friend who was interested in journalism.
                        We co-founded the magazine together to act as a way to discuss politcal beliefs with
                        numerous people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We went out of our way to include people from all walks of life and especially
                        those who disagreed with us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Made little to no money month-over-month, but developed a reputation quickly. Eventually was
                        enough to interview local officials and even a state senator prior to the general election.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shortly after dropping out from Concordia College I also left the magazine. It would go under
                        following
                        my other co-founder's departure due to lack of sustainable funding.

                        Taught a handful of young students on the violin. Most would go on to play
                        in highschool and a few in college now.

                    <li>
                        Began as an offer from my french teacher in high school as I was the
                        principle second violin in my highschool orchestra. Meaning I was the 3rd best violinist
                        in the orchestra.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Taught one class a week with each student typically in their home. The rate was roughly
                        $20 per hour with each section lasting about an hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Had I continued on my path to become a violin performance major I would have had to teach more
                        in college, but that did not work out. Following graduation I stopped teaching in July 2018 to
                        move to Moorhead, Minnesota.
