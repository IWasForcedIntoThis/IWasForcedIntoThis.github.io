                Despite being the first to admit that school was often hard for me —especially at a
                young age due to ADHD— I also love education. Teaching and learning are fun for me
                and I find a deep satisfaction when it comes to them. I hope to be able to engage
                in education after I recieve my bachelors.

                I would also like to pursue a masters in engineering and a PhD in engineering as well.
                Though that'll arrive at a later time in my life they're still long term goals of mine
                in regards to education and my future in it.

                        Returned to college in autumn 2023 as an undeclared student. I immediately started working
                        toward getting into the engineering program. I was eventually able to join the program in autumn
                        2024. During this time I was also invited to join Tau Beta Pi and did so that same semester.
                        I have been closely working with Dr.
                        Carmen Menoni since March 2024 and have been getting increasingly
                        involved in the research being performed there. Often working in maintenance of our systems,
                        but also
                        making new ones as needed by various graduate students in the lab. As someone who is —openly and
                        frustratingly— serious about safety I have been heavily involved in the
                        Ram Rocketry team. Especially wtih assisting in safety procedures and function. E.G.
                        Ensuring proper disposal of expended motors and adherance to laws and regulations as required.
                        Often to the chagrin of my peers.

                        After only a few years of playing the violin I was enthralled. I auditioned for
                        Concordia College's violin performance major and —despite my fears—
                        managed to succeed and got a scholarship. Spent some of my freetime as a journalist for my
                        magazine. Interviewed several people in local governments and wrote nearly 3 dozen essays in one
                        year. Eventually ran out of both funds and motivation as I realized my peers were not the
                        type of people I wanted to be around. After dropping out —with a freely admitted horrendous
                        GPA— I was a bit listless, but I got the drive to enlist in the US Army and subsequently did so
                        in November of 2019.
