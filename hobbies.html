            <h1>Ice Hockey</h1>
            <p>
                Growing up in Alaska there is very little to do <i>besides winter sports</i>. So
                much like my brothers I fell head-over-heels for hockey growing up. I eventually got
                bitten by the goalie bug and minded the net for most of my time playing hockey as a kid.
                I grew up watching the highlights of Martin Brodeur, Dominik Hasek, and Patrick Roy. I attempted
                to emulate them as best I could. In doing so I developed a style of my own like every goalie.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a serious injury when I was playing as a defenseman, I hung up my skates, but never stopped
                watching my favorite team. The <i>Montreal Canadiens</i>. Through thick and thin I've been a fan
                for the better part of 20 years now. It was Carey Price and his injury that actually
                brought me back to the sport. He inspired me to try it again and now I play adult hockey.
                No where near the level I was before, but hockey is hockey and for me its blood.

            <h1>Mountaineering</h1>
            <p>

                I began getting into mountaineering when I was 21 while stationed at Fort Lewis, WA.

                Initially was just a few long hikes, but they eventually became multi-day trips to the mountains of
                Washington state.

                We managed to summit Mount Hopper —partially— in 2022. It was a huge experience for me and was perhaps
                my favorite to date.

            </p>
            <p>
                Despite that its been a while since I've gone up again. I would like to soon though!
                My goal is to eventually do a through-hike through Hoh Rainforest as well as summit
                —properly this time— Mount Hopper, Mount Rainier, and Mount Baker. Though I may have to wait!
                Not a lot of time to go to Washington these days.
